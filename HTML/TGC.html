            The Gratitude Challenge was created by Seth Barnes, the founder of Adventures
            In Missions, in order to bring a sense of one-ness to those who have been affected
            by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. The original idea was presented to the public
            in his blog <br>"<a href="https://www.sethbarnes.com/post/10-call-gratitude-challenge"target="blank">

              We have started The Gratitude Challenge as a way to spread the message of
              being an action. We want to partner with those who are doing all they can
              to fight the virus and to spread love of Christ faster than the virus itself.
